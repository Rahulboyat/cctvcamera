        <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Home Security Cameras</h1>
        <p>If you're starting off with home security, a good place to begin is with a security camera.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="solution_text">
        <p>CCTV. NVR. DVR. WIFI. With so many acronyms and a bevy of different devices, the world of home security
          cameras
          can be a lot, especially if you’re not familiar with home security in general. Well, we’re here to help. Over
          the years, we’ve tested out and reviewed dozens of security cameras, from wired to wireless, from indoor to
          outdoor and everything in between. Here, we’re going over the different types of cameras, whether you need one
          or not, how to install them, and more. If it’s security camera-related, we’ve got you covered.</p>
      </div>

      <p><b>Home security</b> cameras are devices that monitor and protect your home. You can purchase indoor and
        outdoor
        security cameras. And they often include HD resolution and other features like two-way talk, night vision, and
        smartphone controls.</p>

      <h3>Do I Need A Home Security Camera?</h3>
      <p>The first question you may ask yourself is simple: is a security camera necessary in the first place? And the
        answer depends on the level of security you want to add to your home or business. While sensors can detect
        motion,
        letting you know if doors or windows have been opened or closed, without cameras, you can’t actually see what’s
        going on at home.</p>

      <h3>How Many Security Cameras Do I Need?</h3>
      <p>The amount of security cameras you need depends on the size of your home as well as the amount of security you
        want in general. At a minimum, we recommend putting a camera in the main entrance of your home on the ground
        floor. Ideally, you also use outdoor security cameras on all ground floor entrances; however, this won’t apply
        to
        someone living in an apartment. For more security, you can put more security cameras on the ground level, and in
        any room that you use frequently or must pass through to enter or exit your home. For additional security, you
        can
        put security cameras in main hallways on second or third floors. However, we don’t recommend placing cameras in
        bedrooms or bathrooms because of privacy issues. In fact, putting up cameras in those places is illegal in some
        states. Learn more about the legality of security cameras.</p>

      <div class="solution_content2">
        <p><b>Indoor Cameras: </b>Indoor cameras, which typically cost around $100, should be placed on the ground level
          of your home at the very least. Avoid private areas like bathrooms or bedrooms, but cover any area that’s
          easily
          accessible, like a front hallway, or any area that’s central to your home, like a living room. Indoor cameras
          are more likely to be plug-in than outdoor cameras, which may not be near an outlet. Most indoor cameras
          require
          Wi-Fi or an internet connection, except a few that connect and record directly to a DVR or NVR. And even most
          NVR- and DVR-connected cameras these days connect to the internet to provide you with remote alerts.</p>

        <p><b>Outdoor Cameras:</b> Outdoor cameras, on the other hand, tend to cost around $200. The reason? They come
          with weather-resistant cases so that they can withstand large temperature ranges as well as various solids and
          liquids, be it rain, snow, hail or dust. How you determine how durable a camera is will depend on the IP
          rating,
          which we detail below in our buying guide. Unlike indoor cameras, outdoor cameras are more likely to be
          wireless
          — meaning that they’re powered by batteries and connect to Wi-Fi — due to fewer outdoor outlets; check out our
          list of the best outdoor wireless cameras to explore your options. But one thing that is important to note is
          that wireless cameras may still require the internet. Very rarely, though, we see outdoor cameras with a 4G
          SIM
          card that replaces Wi-Fi. These 4G cameras, like the Arlo Go, cost about</p>

        <p><b>Wireless Cameras: </b>Wireless cameras are much easier to install than wired cameras, but of course, we
          had
          to take battery life into consideration; a year is a reasonable time period for a camera to last, in our
          opinion. While some batteries are rechargeable, some we have to replace completely every so often. Some
          outdoor
          cameras, like the Ring Spotlight Cam Solar, come with solar panels, meaning that they charge continuously from
          the sun, never requiring a battery change. To learn more, check out our page on the costs of Ring cameras.</p>

        <p><b>WiFi-Connected Cameras (Digital or IP Camera): </b>These days, most security cameras are WiFi-connected,
          meaning that they have a corresponding app that allows us to livestream footage, receive motion or
          person-activated notifications, and control our camera remotely. This took our home monitoring from local only
          to remote; we could literally see what was going on at home from anywhere in the world, so long as it had
          Wi-Fi.
          For the most comprehensive monitoring, we recommend getting a smart security camera, meaning it’s connected to
          the Internet.</p>

        <ul class="p-0">
          <li><b>Digital Video Recorders (DVR):</b> DVR cameras are typically analog cameras, meaning they’re not
            Wi-Fi-connected; they’re usually part of wired security systems. Typically, the camera connects to a hard
            drive via a coaxial cable.</li>

          <li><b>Network Video Recorders (NVR):</b> The majority of NVR cameras are Wi-Fi-connected, otherwise known as
            IP
            or Internet Protocol cameras. These cameras can either be wired or wireless. If they are wired, they likely
            use Ethernet cables rather than coaxial cables.</li>

          <li><b>Cloud Recording:</b> Cloud recording refers to off-site footage recording through a cloud server
            operated by the camera manufacturer or a third-party. Some older IP cameras can use your own cloud storage
            (e.g. Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.), but most cameras nowadays use their own subscription-based cloud
            storage. That is, you pay the company monthly or yearly to store videos in the cloud. The advantage of cloud
            storage is that you can view your footage anywhere with an internet connection, and if your camera gets
            destroyed, you’ll still have access to its recordings.</li>


          <li><b>Night vision Camera : </b>Obviously, it’s important that a camera can show you what’s going on at night
            as well as during the day. Night vision comes in two forms: either infrared via LED sensors, which produces
            black and white footage, or color from a bright white spotlight, as seen in our Ring Spotlight Cam Battery
            review. If night vision is particularly important to you, might we suggest reading about the best infrared
            cameras?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Monitoring</h2>
        <p>Finally, there’s monitoring. Most cameras let us monitor them for free through the mobile application, but
          some offered or even required 24/7 professional monitoring, especially if it was part of a larger security
          system. Take abode’s monitoring costs, for example. While we self-monitored through the app, we wanted the
          extra protection of having a team of people behind us 24/7 if we were busy or unable to call for help. That
          cost us $20 a month or $100 a year and included 30 days of cloud storage, which is often combined with
          monitoring subscriptions. Again, the monthly and yearly costs differ greatly, but there’s no reason to pay
          more than $40 a month for professional monitoring, especially given how these costs are getting lower and
          lower.</p>

        <p>Take note that in most cases, the alarm company won’t be able to check in and see your livestreams, which is
          good news for your privacy. You wouldn’t want a random stranger sitting in a monitoring center to see you in a
          towel, right? However, some companies, such as SimpliSafe, offer video verification. What this means is that
          during emergencies, the monitoring center gets temporary access to your livestream to see what’s going on.
          This supposedly speeds up police response. That’s something to keep in mind.</p>
